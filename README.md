# breakoutUploadTest
just testing uploading projects on github

For my first "project" i wanted to remake a game to the best of my ability. In this project, there is many bugs that I intend to fix at a later date such as 
 - the ball getting stuck to the user or
 - a hit being registered without the ball richocheting 

in addition, several features i want to add is a timer or adding an additional way to remove the blocks via a laser function however 
im content with the functionality of the game for now

also need to restyle the document and do something about responsiveness on a cellular size screen as 
the blocks aren't contained within the grid when adjusted to that screen size
