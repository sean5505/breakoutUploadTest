## Overview

A cheap remake of Atari Breakout, a game with the goal of clearing all blocks without letting the ball hit the horizon. As the ball collides with the blocks, the block vanishes and the user earns points. The speed at which the ball moves can be adjusted by the difficulty setting. As a result, playing at a higher difficulty level allows the user to accumulate additional points.

### Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

## Development

### **Tech stack**

For my initial project, I delved into the fundamentals of Front-End Development, focusing on `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. These three core technologies formed the backbone of the project, enabling me to establish the structure, apply appealing styles, and implement interactive functionality to the game.

## Challenges

##### **Bugs & Defects**

As a beginner in my first project, I encountered several challenges while expanding the functionality of the game, mainly due to my limited knowledge and experience. Despite these obstacles, I remained diligent and persevered, successfully resolving some of the issues, although not all of them. This experience has taught me valuable lessons and has motivated me to continue learning and improving my skills in order to overcome future obstacles more effectively.

## Conclusion

While the project remains a work in progress, it has served as a valuable opportunity for me to consolidate the knowledge acquired during my earlier studies. Looking ahead, my goal is to evolve the game into a more comprehensive rendition of Atari Breakout, incorporating additional levels and power-ups to enhance the sense of achievement and progression. Furthermore, I hope to address minor glitches and explore the implementation of a feature to save the players highest scores across their attempts.
